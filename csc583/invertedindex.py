class InvertedIndex:
    """
    Class InvertedIndex takes in a text file containing the DocID and words as input to create an positional index
    It contains methods to calculate the query containing 2 terms and distance k between them.
    Public Methods: read_txt_file, q7_1_1, q7_1_2, q7_2
    Private Methods: _parse_query, _create_positional_index, _get_doc_id_from_line, _positional_intersect_bidirectional,
